#EAT-DA-BURGER
An Introduction to Eat-Da-Burger!
ORDER UP! Create a burger, eat it, delete it or prepare another. This app uses node, express, handlebars and mySQL. 

How does it work?
This full stack Node JS app uses a basic MySQL database, Express for the server, and Handlebars as its template engine. It is currently deployed on Heroku.  Updates are made by Ajax calls to the specified POST and PUT routes.

The page is styled with google fonts and custom CSS. Handlebars creates the front end using my designed HTML code with light jQuery for the form handling.

Who will use this?
A burger joint may use this app to allow customers to handle completing their burger orders.
